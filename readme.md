#Purpose
Alot of images I would get from designers were saved in CMYK instead of RGB, poorly optimized, or had color profiles attatched to them. Color profiles do not work consistently across browsers: removing them works best for my workflow. The easiest way I found to remove color profiles before writing this little tool was to open the image in Preview.app and save it. I noticed that the filesize was generally much smaller than the non-Preview.app saved file.

I wrote this tool to convert CMYK images to RGB, strip color profiles, and get some of the file optimization benefits that Preview.app provided.
